Stela-iOS
=========

The Stela app for iOS goes great with the [Pebble Stela app](https://github.com/jloloew/Stela-Pebble).

Stela requires a Pebble smartwatch to function.

Read on your Pebble smartwatch! Just browse to the article you want to read, tap the Stela button, and off you go! It's so easy, your mother can do it!

When you press the button on your iPhone, Stela for Pebble is automatically launched, and the article is sent to your Pebble.

When the article is sent to the watch, all images, share buttons, sidebars, and ads are stripped out so you can read just the article you actually want to read.

Love reading, but don't want to stop? Ever feel like you have little pockets of free time during the day, but they're not long enough to do anything? Use Stela! Since the Pebble is water-resistant, you can now read in the shower! (Just because you can doesn't mean that you should...)
