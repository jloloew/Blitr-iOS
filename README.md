Stela requires a Pebble smartwatch to function.

Read on your Pebble smartwatch! Just browse to the article you want to read, tap the Stela button, and off you go! It's so easy, my mother can do it!

When you press the button on your iPhone, Stela for Pebble is automatically launched, the article is sent to your Pebble, and your iPhone is no longer needed.

When the article is sent to the watch, all images, share buttons, sidebars, and ads are stripped out so you can read just the article you actually want to read.

Got a four hour bus ride, but only 5% battery left on your iPhone? With Stela, you don't have to choose between four hours of boredom and calling for a ride when your bus arrives. Load up some reading material onto your watch, turn off your iPhone, cross your arms, put your head down, and read!

Love reading, but don't want to stop? Ever feel like you have little pockets of free time during the day, but they're not long enough to do anything? Use Stela! Since the Pebble is water-resistant, you can now read in the shower! 

Browse with slick swipe gestures, and tap the side of your screen to show and hide the controls.
